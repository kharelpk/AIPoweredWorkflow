Users can save a lot of time using our AI-Powered Automation Workflow. This intelligent functionality allows users to generate automation scripts for a wide variety of devices such as motorized stages, lasers, sensors, cameras, and more. Users simply need to input specific prompts based on the devices currently supported. For example, a prompt could be as simple as "Home the CNC machine, and take a picture using the ueye camera after homing." Alternatively, it can handle more complex instructions, like "I have two Thorlabs stages with brushless DC motor controllers. I am using the Pure Photonics laser and measuring optical power using a Thorlabs power meter. I want to run gradient search optimization on the two stages to maximize optical power." The platform swiftly responds with a Python script and additional code information. This AI-driven process drastically cuts down time previously spent on writing drivers and generating code, making hardware automation swift, efficient, and user-friendly.
